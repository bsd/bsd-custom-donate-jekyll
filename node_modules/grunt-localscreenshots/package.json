  "readme": "# grunt-localscreenshots\n\nThis is my modification of original grunt-autoshot plugin. (https://github.com/Ferrari/grunt-autoshot)\n\nWith this plugin you can make screenshots of all static html files located inside of some directory.\n\nCreate a quick screenshot for your site which could help for document or testing. \nInspired by [Testing your responsive design with PhantomJS](http://daker.me/2013/07/testing-your-responsive-design-with-phantomjs.html), also suport different resolution base on your viewport, it's useful to responsive design.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt.\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-localscreenshots --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-localscreenshots');\n```\n\nFinal and the most important thing, please make sure [**phantomjs**](http://phantomjs.org/) are in your PATH, cause this plugin use it to generate screenshot, so remember [install](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) first.\n\n## The \"autoshot\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `localscreenshots` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  \t\tlocalscreenshots: {\n\t\t\t\toptions: {\n\t\t\t\t\tpath: 'screenshots',\n\t\t\t\t\ttype: 'png',\n\t\t\t\t\tlocal : {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpath: 'public',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tport: 3000\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\tviewport: ['600x800', '768x1024', '1024x1024'],\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tsrc: ['public/*.html']\n\t\t}\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.path\nType: `String`\n\nPath to the directory which screenshots will be saved.\n\n\n#### options.type\nType: String\n\nImage type of screenshot.  \nPhantomJS supports JPEG, PNG, GIF and PDF right now.\n\n\n\n#### options.local\nType: String\n\nStart a local http server to host your webpage then get the screenshot. There are several config options:\n```\n{\n  path: './dist', // path to directory of the webpage\n  port: 8080      // port of startup http server\n}\n```\n\n#### options.viewport\nType: Array\n\nAutoshot could create the screenshot base on given viewport, it's helpful if you want to test responsive webpage.\n```\nex: ['1024x768', '1920x1080']\n```\nYou could add any resolution you want, just follow the same format.",
